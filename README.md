# Vue 3 Api Composition + Vite

This repository is just a simple POC of Vue3 API Composition with Vite. It's just to remember some configs / best practises.   

Tested with:
- Vue Router
- VueX (typed)
- Store with API Composition / global state
- Inject services with inject / provide
- Services with ref
- Global SCSS injection with main file
- TS Path configuration
- Proxy configuration for HTTP request in dev server
- Integration of Jest and Cypress
